# Architecture

Toroid is Conway's Game of Life on a toroidal (wrapping) grid. The board wraps at edges: a cell that moves off the right edge reappears on the left. Web, iOS, macOS, and watchOS (standalone) implementations share the same rules. The engine is implemented twice: once in JavaScript and once in Swift, pinned to the same test cases so they cannot diverge. No accounts, no network, no storage — just the rules and the grid.

## How it runs

**Web:** User navigates to toroid.heyitsmejosh.com. The landing page (`index.html`) shows a hero and a live board in the background, pre-loaded with a Gosper gun pattern. `play.html` is the full interactive version: draw patterns by clicking cells, step or auto-run at variable speeds, clear, randomize, or load a preset pattern. The grid size is responsive to viewport size; patterns are preserved when the grid resizes. The engine is `life.js` (see below).

**iOS/macOS:** Apps launch with a blank grid. SwiftUI views let users click cells to toggle them, press buttons to step/run, adjust speed, and load preset patterns. The engine is `Life.swift`, a line-for-line port of `life.js`. macOS gets a slightly larger default window.

**watchOS:** Standalone companion app (not mirrored from iOS). Pages through six preset patterns on a fixed 12x12 board. Shows population count and generation number. The engine is a 12x12 port of `Life.swift` embedded directly in the watchOS app.

## Engine

The toroidal grid is stored as a flat `Uint8Array` (JavaScript) or `[UInt8]` (Swift), with double buffering for the next generation. Wrap is resolved once per row and once per column instead of computing modulo on each of the 8 neighbor reads, speeding up a step by 4-5x.

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `life.js` | JavaScript engine. `Life` class with constructor (cols, rows), `get`/`set`/`toggle`, `clear`, `randomize` (random distribution), `neighbors` (count for one cell), `step` (advance one generation), `population` (count live cells), and `stamp` (place a pattern from ASCII art). Toroidal wrap via modulo on x and y. Double-buffered generation. The `step()` method unrolls wrap computation to avoid the modulo on each neighbor read. |
| `life.test.js` | Test suite for the engine. Verifies the four rules: live cell survives on 2 or 3 neighbors, dies otherwise; dead cell is born on exactly 3. Checks corner cases and torus wrap. Run with `node life.test.js`. Tests are shared by `ios/Checks/main.swift` so the Swift version cannot drift. |
| `ios/Conway/Life.swift` | Line-for-line port of `life.js` to Swift. Same methods and behavior. Returns `[UInt8]` for the grid. Toroidal wrap via modulo. Double-buffered generation. Must stay synchronized with the JavaScript version via shared test vectors. |
| `ios/Checks/main.swift` | Test suite for `Life.swift`. Mirrors `life.test.js`. Run after building: `swiftc ios/Conway/Life.swift ios/Checks/main.swift -o /tmp/c && /tmp/c`. |
| `watchos/Models/Life.swift` | Hardcoded 12x12 port of the engine for watchOS. Smaller grid so it fits comfortably on a watch face with tap targets. Uses the same `step()` logic. |

## Web

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Landing page with hero, tagline, and a live interactive board in the background showing a Gosper gun pattern. SVG canvas with mouse/touch support to step generations or watch auto-run. Styled for desktop and mobile. Click the pattern to open `play.html`. |
| `play.html` | Full interactive Game of Life player. SVG grid, click to toggle cells, toolbar with step/run/speed controls, clear/randomize/pattern-load buttons. Preserves patterns when the viewport resizes. Queries `?w=400&h=400` for initial board size. |
| `privacy.html` | Privacy policy. |
| `devices.css` | Device frame styling for landing and web app. Responsive iPhone/Android/Mac containers. |
| `src/lib/tools.js` | Web app helpers. Board serialization, pattern loading, preset patterns (Gosper gun, glider, blinker, etc.). Called by both `index.html` and `play.html`. |
| `sw.js` | Service worker. Caches the app shell for offline play. |
| `tools.test.mjs` | Test suite for `src/lib/tools.js`. Verifies board serialization, pattern loading, and preset patterns. Run with `node tools.test.mjs`. |
| `scripts/deploy.sh` | Deployment script. Builds the web app and deploys to Cloudflare Pages. |

## iOS and macOS

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `ios/Conway/ConwayApp.swift` | iOS entry point. Single `WindowGroup` with `ContentView()`. Share button overlay. |
| `macos/Conway/ConwayApp.swift` | macOS entry point. `WindowGroup` with larger default size. Same `ContentView` as iOS but with menu bar and more screen real estate. |
| `ios/Conway/ContentView.swift` | Main UI for iOS and macOS. SVG grid rendering (or CoreGraphics on macOS). Toolbar with step/run/speed controls, clear, randomize, pattern-load buttons. Tap or click to toggle cells. Handles pinch-to-zoom on iOS. |
| `ios/Conway/Life.swift` | The engine (see above). |

## watchOS

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `watchos/ToroidWatchApp.swift` | watchOS app entry point. Single `NavigationStack` with `ContentView` (page navigation). |
| `watchos/Views/GridView.swift` | 12x12 grid display. Shows live cells as filled squares, dead cells as empty. Read-only on this view. |
| `watchos/Views/ControlsView.swift` | Buttons to step/run and toggle auto-play. Speed control (fast/medium/slow). Tap targets sized for watch interaction. |
| `watchos/Models/Life.swift` | 12x12 Game of Life engine. Simplified for a smaller board. |
| `watchos/Models/Board.swift` | Wrapper around a `Life` instance to track UI state (running, speed, current pattern). |

## Kotlin Multiplatform

Note: Toroid's KMP implementation (if created) would mirror the JavaScript and Swift engines, sharing the same test cases in Kotlin.

## Cloudflare Workers

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `functions/api/[[route]].js` | REST API endpoint. `GET /api/step?board=...` takes a board state, advances it one generation, and returns the new state. Allows browser agents to run Game of Life without client-side JavaScript (used by autonomous testing). Board is encoded as a base64 string or similar compact format. |
| `functions/mcp.js` | Model Context Protocol server. Registers a `step` tool so agents can advance the game via MCP. Same implementation as the REST API, calls the engine so the two cannot drift. |

## Presets and utilities

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/tools.js` | Preset patterns: Gosper gun (famous 60-cycle pattern), glider (moves 4 cells every 4 generations), blinker (oscillates every 2 gens), toad, pulsar, beacon. Patterns are stored as ASCII art (`. ` for dead, `O` for alive) and stamped onto the board via `Life.stamp()`. |

## Gotchas

- **Toroidal wrap:** The grid wraps at edges. A glider that exits the right side reappears on the left. This is by design, not a bug. It means there is no "edge" in the classical sense, and some patterns that would die on an infinite grid survive indefinitely on a torus.
- **Performance:** The `step()` method avoids calling `idx(x, y)` (which computes two modulos) for each of the 8 neighbor reads per cell. Instead, it computes the wrap once per row and once per column. This speeds up a 400x400 board by 4-5x, keeping 60 fps playable.
- **Double buffering:** The engine uses two grids, swapping them after each generation. This avoids read-after-write bugs where a cell's death before processing its neighbors would change the outcome.
- **Engine parity:** `life.js` and `ios/Conway/Life.swift` must stay perfectly synchronized. Divergence is a bug, not an improvement. Both are pinned by the same test cases in `life.test.js` and `ios/Checks/main.swift`.
- **Wrapping on tiny boards:** On a 1x1 board, a cell is its own neighbor in all 8 directions, so it sees itself 8 times. This is correct toroidal behavior. On a 1xN board, each cell sees itself 6 times (horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally). All edge cases are handled by the modulo arithmetic, not special-cased.
- **No persistence:** The app does not save state across sessions. Each launch starts with a blank grid or a preset. This is by design to keep the app focused and simple.
